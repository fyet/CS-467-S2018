                * PHP My Admin * 

1. Go to http://18.188.194.159/phpmyadmin/

2. Enter the credentials below:

Username: root
Password: camelopardalis


		* mysql from command line * 

1. SSH into EC2 Instance

2. Enter the command “mysql –u root –p”

3. Enter the password: camelopardalis
The database to connect to is titled “camelopardalis”. The schema is available in our shared google drive folder

The reason why we have a 'config.php' file is so that we can easily change the configuration of database without having to change 
code in all of our source codes. This way our source codes are portable, and if we decide to host the SQL server someplace else later
we only have to update one file and our entire project will still work. When writing queries on any of our web pages, please always 
connect to the db using the following php excerpt:

    <?php
      require_once('config.php');  // this connects using the single set of credentials we have provided in config doc
      $query = "[query goes here]";               
      $response = mysqli_query($dbc, $query);   
    
        // code here to handle response

      mysqli_close($dbc) // close the connection we just instantiated 
    ?>   

I recommend we use 'mysqli'. Documentation can be found here: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php. I wrote config in procedural 
but we can go with object oriented if prefered. It doesnt matter to me. 

Note: I have hosted pages that show what is in our db so you dont have to sign in through PHPMyAdmin. The landing pages are:

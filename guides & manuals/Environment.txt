Notes: Since we have chosen to use OSU's Apache webserver, we are constrained to our own test environments. We will not 
       have access to a shared test environment or a shared production environment. The systems administrators keep everything 
       segregated between students. As such, our GitHub repository will be very important so we can all have access to, and work 
       with, the most updated versions of code eachother has. This document shares some general information with the group on 
       setting up test environments. Only one of us has to host our final version of the project so it can be graded. We will need 
       to find a clean way to consolidate all of our respective sources. I recommend we save all our sources in the "public_html"
       directory so we have a single place where we can locate them. This will also translate well with deployment to school 
       servers (below). 

i.      Go to https://it.engineering.oregonstate.edu/use-php-your-engr-web-pages and review instructions 
ii.     Clone the github repository to retrieve code locally (or pull to ensure local repository is up to date if already cloned)
iii.    Open FTP client and connect to OSU’s servers 
iv.     Navigate to the “public_html” directory within local git repository from FTP client
v.      Transfer all files to your “public_html” on school servers
vi.     Navigate to http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~[ONID]/[Filename.ext] (Which ever page you are trying to hit. Probably will need to start at home page)



                                                              *    Database    *

Notes: Much like OSU's configurations around Apache and PHP, there are also restrictions/controls in place regarding MySQL. We are not 
       able to instantiate a group db on school servers. They limit each student to one ONID Web Database with PHPMyAdmin access. We
       can just use mine. **Please do not delete any of my other tables. Their existance doesn't hurt our project, and I have projects 
       from other classes that still rely on some of these tables**.

i.     To access PHPMyAdmin, go to https://secure.oregonstate.edu/oniddb/. 
ii.    See the config.php file in “public_html” on GitHub repo for credentials
iii.   If, for whatever reason, you want to set up the database through your ONID instead of mine, go here: http://onid.oregonstate.edu/ 
iv.    Login, go to "Web Database", and copy the ONID Database Settings into the config.php file. You can then connect to PHPMyAdmin with 
       your db credentials instead of mine. 

The reason why we have a 'config.php' file is so that we can easily change the configuration of database without having to change 
code in all of our source codes. This way our source codes are portable, and if we decide to host the SQL server someplace else later
we only have to update one file and our entire project will still work. When writing queries on any of our web pages, please always 
connect to the db using the following php excerpt:

    require_once('config.php');             // this connects using the single set of credentials we have provided in config doc
    $query = "[query goes here]";               
    $response = mysqli_query($dbc, $query);   

I recommend we use 'mysqli'. Documentation can be found here: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php. I wrote config in procedural but we can 
go with object oriented if prefered. It doesnt matter to me. 

Note: I have hosted pages that show what is in our db so you dont have to sign in through PHPMyAdmin. The landing pages are:
